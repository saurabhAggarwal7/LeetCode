/**
 * Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

 //XOR solution:
 /**
  * The basic idea is to use XOR operation. We all know that a^b^b =a, which means two xor operations with the same number will eliminate the number and reveal the original number.
In this solution, I apply XOR operation to both the index and value of the array. In a complete array with no missing numbers, the index and value should be perfectly corresponding( nums[index] = index), so in a missing array, what left finally is the missing number.
