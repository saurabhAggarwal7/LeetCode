 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
 * 
 * SOLUTION::::
 * 
 * Just binary search, each time check citations[mid]
case 1: citations[mid] == len-mid, then it means there are citations[mid] papers that have at least citations[mid] citations.
case 2: citations[mid] > len-mid, [RIGHT] then it means there are citations[mid] papers that have moret than citations[mid] citations, so we should continue searching in the left half
case 3: citations[mid] < len-mid, [LEFT] we should continue searching in the right side
After iteration, it is guaranteed that right+1 is the one we need to find (i.e. len-(right+1) papars have at least len-(righ+1) citations)
